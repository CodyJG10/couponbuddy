            Traditional print advertising (Newspapers, magazines, mailings, flyers, Brochures, periodicals etc.) are a costly option for the small business and may not be affordable to many businesses. Additionally, Print ads are static and, once printed, cannot be changed until the next printing, thus, leading to higher costs to change and modify the coupon deals. Newspaper & magazine ads can run from $400 to $3,000 depending on the size of an ad and that is generally for one printing, which may have a distribution of 5,000 to 30,000 people. The higher the distribution, the more costly the advertisement. These advertisements, especially the smaller ones, may contain only 1 coupon.
            Flyers and brochures containing coupons are costly to print and require proper distribution, which is a costly and tedious endeavor.
            Mailers, such as Money Mailer and ValPak are costly, even for 1 mailing to approximately 10,000 households. Further, almost half of these mailings never get opened or make it into the home.
            Coupon Network has developed a low cost alternative to distributing coupons to the customers who are interested in our products and services. We have developed a coupon distributing kiosk, which offers your business exposure with a digital ad and up to 6 changeable coupons. Thus, a customer who is interested in your business can choose any or all of your coupon deals by selecting them on a touchscreen, and the coupon can be sent to their phone, emailed to them, or scanned on the spot. The complete flexibility of changing your coupons anytime..immediately cannot be undervalued. This simply cannot be done in traditional print advertisements and offers great value. The cost of advertising your coupon deals for an entire year is usually less than what you would pay for one newspaper (One day), magazine (one printing) or mailing (one mailing) insertion.
            Our high-volume locations offer your coupon deals to well over 500,000 annually.
            Our kiosks are impressive and demand attention as they stand 6.5 feet high and include a 42” touchscreen to navigate to the coupons of choice. The customer selects the coupons of interest and they are sent out for their immediate use.
